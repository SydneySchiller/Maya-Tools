# Maya-Tools

### ObjectRenamer.py
This tool scans through the existing items (Lights, Models, Joints, etc.) in the scene and applies a suffix to the end of each name. This establishes a common naming convention for the Maya project.

Lights &rarr; \_lgt
Polygonal Model &rarr; \_geo
Joints &rarr; \_jnt

~To Do: Add more suffixes~
